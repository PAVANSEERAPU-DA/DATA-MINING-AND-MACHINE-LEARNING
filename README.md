# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on **credit card fraud detection** and **diabetes prediction**, developed as part of my preparation for the Master of Science in Data Analytics. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, machine learning model implementation, evaluation, and visualization on real-world datasets.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**

   * Dataset: `creditcard.csv`
   * Goal: Identify fraudulent transactions using classification models.

2. **Diabetes Prediction**

   * Dataset: `diabetes.csv`
   * Goal: Predict the presence of diabetes based on health-related attributes.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Applied

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

### Diabetes Prediction

* **Linear Regression**
* **Random Forest Regressor**

> 🔄 Note: Although diabetes prediction is a classification problem, regression models are used here for experimental and educational comparison.

## ⚙️ Key Steps and Methods

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature scaling (StandardScaler)
* Train-test split
* Model training and evaluation
* Visualization of results

## 📈 Performance Evaluation

### Classification (Fraud Detection)

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-Score
* Confusion Matrix

### Regression (Diabetes Dataset)

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* R-squared Score (R²)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
